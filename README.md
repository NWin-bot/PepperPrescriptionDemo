# Abstract

Pepper Prescription is a disease recognition web service that gives a real-time diagnosis of illness and severity based on an image input of a leaf of a sweet pepper plant. The image is first resized, converted to grayscale and normalized. OTSU and HSB masking is then applied so that the diseased area can be characterized and classified against the train and test AI and severity can be calculated from varying pixel counts in segmentations. Once the disease and severity are established, the flask framework would be able to relay the results and pull the recommended treatment fulfilling the webservice. This service aims to reduce, and eliminate, disease spread amongst sweet pepper crops through education. In turn, the overall shortage and quality of local produce will be positively impacted resulting in heightened GDP.

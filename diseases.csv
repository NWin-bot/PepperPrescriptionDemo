Early Blight,"Early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. Early blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85˚F.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked. [earlyblight]","Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a bull's eye"" pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged.","Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems. | Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut. | Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation. | Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry. | For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed. | Remove and destroy all garden debris after harvest and practice crop rotation the following year. | Burn or bag infected plant parts. Do NOT compost.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/potato-blight.jpg
Late Blight,"Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides. Eventually the entire plant will become infected. True to its name, the disease occurs later in the growing season with symptoms often not appearing until after blossom. Unlike other fungal diseases, this plant problem does not overwinter in the soil or on garden trash. Instead the spores are introduced by infected tubers, transplants or seeds. Wind will also carry the disease from nearby gardens. Warm temperatures (70-80˚F) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. [lateblight]","Late blight first appears on the lower, older leaves as water-soaked, gray-green spots. As the disease matures, these spots darken and a white fungal growth forms on the undersides. Eventually the entire plant will become infected.","Plant resistant cultivars when available. | Remove volunteers from the garden prior to planting and space plants far enough apart to allow for plenty of air circulation. | Water in the early morning hours, or use soaker hoses, to give plants time to dry out during the day - avoid overhead irrigation. | Destroy all debris after harvest. | Apply a copper based fungicide (2 oz/ gallon of water) every 7 days or less, following heavy rain or when the amount of disease is increasing rapidly. If possible, time applications so that at least 12 hours of dry weather follows application.",https://www.planetnatural.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/late-blight-tomato.jpg
Alternaria,"There are several species of Alternaria that are pathogenic on perennials. Together they have a wide host range including Aster, Calendula, Coreopsis, Dianthus, Gypsophila, Helianthus, Iris, Ligularia, Pelargonium, Platycodon, Shasta, and Stokesia.","Dark colored leaf spots, lesions may have concentric rings within the lesion. Spots may coalesce, resulting in blighting of foliage. Petals of some plants may be infected. Flower buds of Dianthus can be rotted.",Maintain adequate plant spacing to allow for good aeration to reduce humidity levels around plants. Alternaria spp. require leaf wetness for germination and infection; reduce durations of leaf wetness periods with good timing of overhead irrigation. Regular fungicide applications will likely be necessary to reduce losses on especially susceptible hosts.,https://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/styles/optimized/public/2021-09/hgic_veg_alternaria%20on%20leaf_1576454-PPT.jpg?itok=iPT6bbgU
Cercospora,"Cercospora leaf spot is a common disease in beetroot and silver beet but is usually unimportant in well-managed crops. It may be a significant problem in crops grown for baby-leaf production, because the foliage is the saleable product.","Small, brown flecks develop with a reddish border, expanding to circular spots about 4mm wide with an ashy-grey centre. This tissue becomes thin and brittle, and often drops out, leaving a ragged hole.","Apply the recommended fungicides, particularly during warm, wet weather. Rotate beet crops with other non-host vegetables. Control weeds, particularly Chenopodium weeds like fat-hen, in and around beet crops. | Specific controls are not usually required for capsicum. | Plant only high-quality seed. Do not plant seed potentially infected with Cercospora. | Destroy infected crops promptly after the final harvest and before replanting to minimise disease spread to subsequent crops.",https://nwdistrict.ifas.ufl.edu/hort/files/2013/08/cercospora-pepper-2.jpg
Mild Mottle Virus,Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV) is a plant virus that occurs worldwide and infects capsicums and some other solanaceous plants. The virus is easily spread by contact. Seed transmission can also occur. [mildmottlevirus],"Like its name suggests the virus often produces mild symptoms on leaves of infected capsicum and chilli plants, however in some varieties leaf symptoms may be absent. Symptoms on capsicum fruit, including blistering and necrosis, can cause loss of marketability. The virus readily infects capsicum and chill, and can also infect tomato and eggplant.","Use only healthy seeds and seedlings as the virus can easily be introduced from contaminated sources. | Capsicum varieties are available with resistance to the virus, which may be suitable to reduce its impact on farms where it is present. | Prevent movement of equipment and machinery between farms and between production areas. Ensure all visitors and workers use footbaths each time they enter. | Surfaces, tools and hands can be cleaned by removing dirt first with water and followed with a 20% non-fat dry milk powder solution which is safe and effective. Other disinfectants (e.g. bleach and virkon) can work also.  Change solutions daily or when heavily contaminated with soil or plant material to ensure the solution can work. | Infected plantings should be destroyed and buried as well as all contaminated material including wooden stakes in an area which is not used for cropping. | Remove old finished crops and avoid carryover of plants between growing seasons as many may act as infection sources to new crops. Weeds including nightshade can host the virus and should be destroyed as well. | Rotate plantings and do not plant susceptible plants into areas infected with the virus last year. Melons, pumpkins and zucchini are not affected by the virus and can be used in rotation with capsicum and tomatoes in infected areas. | Do not move people, equipment from older plantings to younger plantings. Clean equipment, including hands and footwear before commencing work.",https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/sites/gateway/files/styles/portrait_large/public/IMG_0964_edited.jpg?itok=-tqqMz3_
Mosaic Virus,"Mosaic viruses can be seed borne or soil borne and are spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. They can also be spread by contact of infected plants, and are most problematic in dry weather. [mosaicvirus]",Green and yellow mottled leaves | Prickly or bumpy surface on fruits | Stunted growth | Low pepper production,"Remove affected plants. There are no effective treatments for viruses. If you suspect mosaic virus, remove the pepper plants from the garden and burn them if possible. The fruits are still safe to eat, but the seeds can carry the virus, so do not save seeds from affected fruits. Keep the pests at bay. Mosaic viruses are commonly spread by sap sucking insects such as aphids. Use a pure neem oil solution with castile soap and water and spray plants to deal with these pests. | Keep the weeds under control. Weeds can carry mosaic virus, and can also be a breeding ground for the insects that spread it. Use a ground cover, or at least keep the weeds at bay with a weeding hoe (these are great for saving your back). | Avoid touching plants. Always wash your hands before and after gardening. Your hands can be the vehicle to transfer viral pathogens from one plant to another. Also, avoid smoking in your garden, as this can introduce mosaic virus to the soil. | Plant resistant pepper varieties. Some varieties have been identified to be more resistant to tobacco mosaic virus, though none are resistant to cucumber mosaic and other viruses. Look for varieties that are labeled 'TMV' (tobacco mosaic virus resistant) at nurseries and garden centers. Some common types are sweet banana, super cayenne, and bell boy hybrid.",https://peppergeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Mosaic-Virus-Pepper-Plant-sm.jpg.webp
